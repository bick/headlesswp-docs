## Rate Limit Headers

| Header Name           | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum allowed requests per rate window.                    |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | Remaining requests within the current window.                |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | Seconds until the rate limit resets.                         |
| `retry-after`         | Suggested wait time (in seconds) before making a follow-up request. |

The default rate limit allows up to 100 requests per second. For trusted users, this limit can be increased upon request.

> **Note:** If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429` response code. We recommend implementing a queue mechanism or reducing concurrent requests per second to avoid this. Contact support if you need a higher rate limit for specific use cases.
